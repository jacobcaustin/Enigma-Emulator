# Enigma-Emulator
Enigma Emulator is a program that implements the Enigma machine encryption.
A description of the Enigma Machine can be found at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) and a [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A) has a good couple of videos about the the Enigma Machine and breaking it's code.

`enigma.machine` contains all the parts that simulate the actual machine as well as the machine itself.
